# 🧮 Add Many Numbers - Python Project

This is a simple Python project that defines a function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers.

### Function Description

- **Function Name**: `add_many_numbers`
- **Input**: A list of integers.
- **Output**: The sum of the integers in the list.

### Example

```plaintext
The sum of the numbers is: 15
📝 How the Code Works:
Function: add_many_numbers
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of those numbers. It uses Python's built-in sum() function to perform the summation.

Main Function:
The main() function:

Creates a list of numbers (for example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).

Calls the add_many_numbers() function to calculate the sum.

Prints the result to the console.

💻 How to Run the Code:
Install Python:

If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from Python.org.

Save the Code:

Copy the code into a file named sum_numbers.py.

Navigate to the Directory:

Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and navigate to the directory where sum_numbers.py is saved.

Run the Code:

In the terminal, run the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python sum_numbers.py
You should see the output:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
The sum of the numbers is: 15
🛠 Code Example:
python
Copy
Edit
def add_many_numbers(numbers: list[int]) -> int:
    """
    Takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers.
    """
    return sum(numbers)  # Use Python's built-in sum() function to calculate the sum

def main() -> None:
    # List of numbers for testing
    numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
    sum_of_numbers: int = add_many_numbers(numbers)  # Get the sum of the numbers
    print(f"The sum of the numbers is: {sum_of_numbers}")  # Print the sum

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
💡 Key Concepts Used:
Functions: We define a function to compute the sum of a list of numbers.

List: A collection of numbers is passed to the function for summation.

Built-in Functions: We used Python's sum() function to simplify the summing process.

Type Hints: Type hints (list[int] and -> int) make the code more readable and informative.

🏅 Expected Output:
plaintext

Edit
The sum of the numbers is: 15
📌 Additional Notes:
This project is useful for understanding basic Python concepts like lists, functions, and loops.

You can extend this project by allowing the user to input their own list of numbers or adding additional functionality like error handling for non-integer inputs.
