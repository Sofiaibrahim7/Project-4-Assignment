ğŸ“Š Count Even Numbers â€” Python Program
ğŸ§  Problem Statement
Create a Python program that:

Asks the user to input integers, one at a time.

The user should press enter without typing a number to stop the input.

After the user stops, the program will print how many even numbers were entered.

ğŸ§ª Solution
Functions:
count_even(lst):

This function receives a list of integers and counts how many of them are even.

It iterates through the list, checking if each number is divisible by 2 (num % 2 == 0).

It prints the count of even numbers.

get_list_of_ints():

This function prompts the user for integers, adding them to a list until the user presses enter without entering a number.

It returns the list of integers.

main():

This function calls get_list_of_ints() to get the list of integers and then passes that list to count_even() to count the even numbers.

            count += 1  # Add one to our count!

    print(count)  # Print out how many even numbers we counted above

    Reads in integers until the user presses enter and returns the resulting list.

Enter an integer or press enter to stop: 2
Enter an integer or press enter to stop: 3
Enter an integer or press enter to stop: 4
Enter an integer or press enter to stop: 
2
ğŸ“Œ Notes
The function count_even(lst) counts and prints the number of even numbers in the provided list lst.

The function get_list_of_ints() collects integer inputs from the user until they press enter without typing anything.
