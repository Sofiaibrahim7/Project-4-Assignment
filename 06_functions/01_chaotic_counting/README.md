ðŸŒ€ Chaotic Counting â€” Python Program
ðŸ§  Problem Statement
You need to write a function chaotic_counting() that prints numbers from 1 to 10, but with a twist. At each number, the program should check if it should stop counting by calling the function done(). If done() returns True, the counting stops early and the program prints "I'm done.".

The function done() returns True with a certain probability, defined by DONE_LIKELIHOOD.

The program should continue printing numbers until either it reaches 10 or done() returns True.

ðŸ§ª Solution
Logic
chaotic_counting():

This function counts from 1 to 10.

Before each number is printed, it checks the result of done().

If done() returns True, the function stops early and exits.

done():

The done() function generates a random number between 0 and 1.

If this number is less than the value of DONE_LIKELIHOOD (which can be adjusted), it returns True, indicating that the program should stop counting.

ðŸ’» Python Code
python

import random

# The likelihood that 'done' will return True
DONE_LIKELIHOOD = 0.5  # You can adjust this value to simulate different behaviors

def chaotic_counting():
    for i in range(10):
        curr_num = i + 1
        # Check if we're done
        if done():
            return  # End the function execution, and we'll go back to main()
        print(curr_num)

def done():
    """ Returns True with a probability of DONE_LIKELIHOOD """
    if random.random() < DONE_LIKELIHOOD:
        return True
    return False

def main():
    print("I'm going to count until 10 or until I feel like stopping, whichever comes first.")
    chaotic_counting()
    print("I'm done")

# This line is required at the end of the Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
ðŸ§ª Example Output
vbnet
I'm going to count until 10 or until I feel like stopping, whichever comes first.
1
2
3
I'm done
ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts
random.random(): Generates a random float between 0 and 1.

DONE_LIKELIHOOD: The probability with which the program stops early. This can be adjusted to change how likely it is to stop counting.

Customization
Modify the DONE_LIKELIHOOD value to adjust the likelihood of stopping. For example:

DONE_LIKELIHOOD = 0.1: 10% chance of stopping each time.

DONE_LIKELIHOOD = 0.9: 90% chance of stopping each time.
