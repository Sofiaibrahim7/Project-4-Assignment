# Phonebook Dictionary Program

## Problem Statement

In this program, we show an example of using dictionaries to keep track of information in a phonebook.

### Features:
- Take input from the user to add names and numbers.
- Store them in a dictionary (`phonebook`).
- Print all the entries in the phonebook.
- Let the user search for a number by name.

## Sample Run:



Name: Ali Number: 12345 Name: Sana Number: 98765 Name: Ali -> 12345 Sana -> 98765 Enter name to
 lookup: Ali 12345 Enter name to lookup: Hamza Hamza is not in the phonebook Enter name to looku

## How It Works:

1. `read_phone_numbers()` – collects input and builds the phonebook dictionary.
2. `print_phonebook()` – displays the full list of contacts.
3. `lookup_numbers()` – lets the user search for a name in the phonebook and returns their number

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required


## Usage:

Just run the program and follow the prompts to enter names, numbers, and look them up.

```bash
python phonebook.py
